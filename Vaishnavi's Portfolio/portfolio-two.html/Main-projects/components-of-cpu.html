          The storage unit is a part of the computer system which is employed to
          store the information and instructions to be processed. A storage
          device is an integral part of the computer hardware which stores
          information/data to process the result of any computational work.
          Without a storage device, a computer would not be able to run or even
          boot up. Or in other words, we can say that a storage device is
          hardware that is used for storing, porting, or extracting data files.
          It can also store information/data both temporarily and permanently.

          A computer power supply is a device that converts electrical energy
          into usable energy for a computer. It takes the energy from an
          external source, like an outlet or generator, and transforms it into
          low-voltage DC power to run the components of your computer.

          SSD stands for Solid-State Drive. It's a type of storage device used
          in computers that is faster and more reliable than traditional hard
          disk drives (HDDs) because it has no moving parts. SSDs use flash
          memory to store data, resulting in quicker boot times, faster file
          transfers, and improved overall system performance.
